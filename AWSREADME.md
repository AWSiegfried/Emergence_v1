# Emergence

## Overview

For this assignment, we were supposed to create an application that includes 2 external APIs and 1 server-side API. The concept was to create an application that solves a real-world problem for which there is no current solution.



## User Story

As a music lover, I want to find local emerging artists and determine as quickly as possible if they fit my taste. This allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of up and coming music without having to search through various websites.
