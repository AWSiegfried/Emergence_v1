# Emergence

## Overview

For this assignment, we were supposed to create an application that includes 2 external APIs and 1 server-side API. The concept was to create an application that solves a real-world problem for which there is no current solution.

## Description

Emergence is the solution to finding new local emerging artists by city.  It aggregates data from various sources and creates a user friendly data-centric overview that gives the user a complete perspective of a band in under 30 seconds.

## User Story

As a music lover, I want to find local emerging artists and determine as quickly as possible if they fit my taste. This allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of up and coming music without having to search through various websites.

## Features

- Sample music 
- Save artists to favorites
- Average audio metrics of artists' top tracks

## Usage

WHEN I type in my city and click on a genre, 
THEN I am presented with a list of artists of that genre in my city.

WHEN I click on an artist, 
THEN I am taken to a page with the artist bio, top tracks, YouTube video and audio features.

WHEN I click on 'save artists', 
THEN that artist will be added to my favorite artists.

WHEN I go back to the home page, 
THEN I can view my saved artists in the dropdown menu in the navbar.

## Future Development

Add a backend for artists to save their own profiles so that they can be added to the database to be searched by users. This will allow the implementation of more than the 2 cities we have.

Add a share functionality to share the page on social media platforms.

Create a way for artists to contact each other and implement functionality so that booking a group of artists for shows becomes easier and faster. 

Add a Google maps functionality so you can see what venues your saved artists typically perform at.
